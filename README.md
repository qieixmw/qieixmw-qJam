# üòª qieixmw-qJam
qieixmw-qJam is a universal ESP32 firmware that has many offensive features.
For now it only supports regular ESP32's, soon there will be more support for more devices.
# üîó How to install
### Easiest way to install is to use my Web Flasher!
### Link: https://qieixmw.github.io/flasher (SOON)
Alternatively, you can download the latest binary from releases or actions and flash locally using esptool.py.
```sh
esptool.py --port COM0 write_flash 0x00000 qieixmw-qJam-<device>.bin
```
# ‚ùî How does it look and why?
qieixmw-qJam has a observation within the community to focus on devices like Flipper Zero. While these devices offer to penetrate into the world of offensive security,
there is a obvious sense that their functions could be archieved without being that overpriced.
